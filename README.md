# bioe245-tutorial

This is a tutorial for the BioE245: Machine Learning for Medical Imaging class at UCSF. Created by [Ilina Bhaya Grossman](https://www.ilinabhayagrossman.com) in Winter 2025.

## What this tutorial covers

This tutorial is meant to introduce students to the basic functions, syntax, and capabilities of Python and Matlab for the purposes of this class. It is not meant to be a comprehensive guide to either language, but rather a starting point for students who are new to programming. There are two folders in this repository: `python` and `matlab`. Each folder contains a Jupyter notebook with examples and exercises for that language. 

The `matlab` folder contains:
- `MatlabTutorial.ipynb`: A Jupyter notebook with examples and exercises for Matlab. This notebook can be run using the [Matlab kernel for Jupyter notebooks] (https://github.com/mathworks/jupyter-matlab-proxy?tab=readme-ov-file#requirements). 
- `MatlabTutorial.m`: A `.m` file with the same examples and exercises that can be run using the Matlab GUI.
- `MatlabTutorialLiveScript.m`: A Matlab Live Script file that can be run in Matlab 2020+ using the Live Editor. 

The `python` folder contains:
- `PythonTutorial.ipynb`: A Jupyter notebook with examples and exercises for Python. This notebook can be run using a Python kernel for Jupyter notebooks or using Binder (see below).

## How to interact with this tutorial

The easiest way to interact with this tutorial is to use Binder. Click the button below to launch an interactive version of the Python tutorial in your web browser:

Alternatively, you can clone this repository to your local machine and run the Jupyter notebooks using Jupyter Lab or Jupyter Notebook. You will need to have Python and Matlab installed on your machine to run the examples and exercises in this tutorial.

For Python, you will need to have the following packages installed:
- numpy
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn
